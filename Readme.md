# This Script uses CharLSTM network to predict the Song lyrics #
This code implements Single -layer Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM,) for training/sampling from character-level language models. In other words the model takes one text file as input and trains a Recurrent Neural Network that learns to predict the next character in a sequence. The RNN can then be used to generate text character by character that will look like the original training data. 

Here we train a Network to predict the song lyrics.
